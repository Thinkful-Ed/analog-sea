  <!-- design note on this form: usually you want to put as little
  friction as possible in the experience of signing up. sure
  your marketers might want to know the customer's name, but
  if the customer doesn't fill out the form because they're
  sick of giving you info about themselves, that's not going
  to help you. This is to say, recognize that there can be
  a tension between getting data from a user and getting them
  to follow through and submit that data as easily and quickly
  as possible. -->
